# ‚úàÔ∏è TravelAgentic

> **üöß Planning Phase**: This repository contains comprehensive planning, architecture, and strategy documentation. Implementation has not yet begun.

An AI-powered travel planning application that will automate the entire trip booking process from search to itinerary generation.

## üöÄ Overview

TravelAgentic is a **planned** open-source AI-first travel planning platform that will:
- Collect user preferences and constraints through intelligent intake
- Search flights, hotels, and activities simultaneously using APIs and browser automation
- Handle booking automation with comprehensive 5-layer fallback system
- Generate personalized PDF itineraries with packing tips and local information
- Provide browser automation and voice call fallbacks for maximum booking success

**Current Status**: üìã **Planning & Architecture Phase** - We're defining the structure, strategy, and technical specifications before development begins.

## üéØ Phase-Based Development Strategy

TravelAgentic follows a strategic 3-phase development approach that balances rapid MVP delivery with production-ready scalability:

### **Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Days 1-2)**
- **Focus**: Core automation with comprehensive mocks
- **APIs**: OpenAI (AI), Stripe (payments), all travel APIs mocked
- **Goal**: Complete booking flow demonstration

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Days 3-4)**
- **Focus**: Real API integration + browser automation fallbacks
- **APIs**: Tequila (flights), Booking.com (hotels), Viator (activities)
- **Fallbacks**: Playwright + browser-use automation for API failures

### **Phase 3: Production Ready (Days 5-6)**
- **Focus**: Advanced features + comprehensive testing
- **APIs**: Twilio Voice, ElevenLabs, Rome2Rio, FlightAware
- **Goal**: Production-ready with 95% feature completeness

## üöÄ Planned Development Setup

```

### 3. Start Development Environment (Future)

```bash
# Start all services (Supabase, Langflow, Redis)
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the web application
cd packages/web
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application (When Built)

- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Langflow UI**: http://localhost:7860
- **Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:54323

## üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Fallback System

TravelAgentic implements a 5-layer fallback hierarchy to ensure maximum booking success:

### **Fallback Hierarchy**
1. **Primary API** ‚Üí Try main travel API (Tequila, Booking.com, Viator) with 3 retries
2. **Secondary API** ‚Üí Switch to alternative provider for same service
3. **Browser Automation** ‚Üí Playwright + browser-use for web scraping when APIs fail
4. **Voice Calling** ‚Üí Twilio + ElevenLabs for manual booking via AI phone calls
5. **User Manual Input** ‚Üí Pause and request user intervention as last resort

### **Browser Automation Features**
- **AI-Powered Navigation**: Natural language instructions to Playwright + browser-use
- **Target Sites**: Google Flights, Booking.com, OpenTable, GetYourGuide
- **Respectful Automation**: Rate limiting, human-like behavior, proper user agents
- **Fallback Coverage**: Flights, hotels, restaurants, activities

## üìÅ Planned Package Structure

### üß† Langflow Package (Planned)
AI workflow orchestration for travel planning logic.
- **Location**: `packages/langflow/` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Visual AI workflows for user preferences, search coordination, and booking automation
- **Key Features**: User intake flows, search orchestration, booking fallback strategies

### üîó Edge Functions Package (Planned)
Serverless API endpoints for external integrations.
- **Location**: `packages/edge-functions/` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: API orchestration for flights, hotels, activities, and bookings
- **Key Features**: Rate limiting, error handling, mock API support

### üåê Web Package (Planned)
Next.js frontend application.
- **Location**: `packages/web/` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: User interface for travel planning and booking
- **Key Features**: Responsive design, authentication, real-time search

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Package (Planned)
Supabase database schema and migrations.
- **Location**: `packages/database/` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Database structure, migrations, and seed data
- **Key Features**: RLS policies, TypeScript types, performance optimization

## üß™ Planned Testing Strategy

### Run Tests with Mock APIs (Planned Approach)

```bash
# Enable mock mode for OSS-friendly development
export USE_MOCK_APIS=true

# Run all tests (when implemented)
npm run test

# Run specific package tests (planned)
npm run test:web
npm run test:edge-functions
npm run test:langflow

# Test browser automation fallbacks (planned)
npm run test:playwright
```

### Run Tests with Real APIs (Future)

```bash
# Requires all API keys to be configured
export USE_MOCK_APIS=false
npm run test

# Test actual browser automation (requires real sites)
npm run test:browser-automation
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests**: API client testing with mocks and real APIs
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user journeys
- **Browser Automation Tests**: Playwright + browser-use for fallback scenarios
- **Failure Simulation**: Mock API failure injection for fallback testing

- **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Development workflow and guidelines
- **[Package READMEs](packages/)** - Detailed documentation for each package

## üîß Development

### Feature Flags

Control feature visibility using environment variables:

```bash
# Phase 1 Features (MVP)
FEATURE_PDF_GENERATION=true
FEATURE_AI_SELECTION=true

# Phase 2 Features (Enhanced)
FEATURE_ACTIVITY_FILTERS=true
FEATURE_BROWSER_FALLBACK=true
ENABLE_CONCURRENT_SEARCH=true

# Phase 3 Features (Advanced)
FEATURE_VOICE_CALLING=false
FEATURE_REAL_PAYMENTS=false
```

### Mock API Development

For contributor-friendly development without API keys:

```bash
# Enable mock APIs (recommended for development)
USE_MOCK_APIS=true

# All external API calls will return realistic mock data
npm run dev
```

**Why Mock APIs?**
- **Zero Setup**: No API keys required for development
- **Consistent Testing**: Predictable responses for automated testing
- **Offline Development**: Work without internet connectivity
- **Cost-Free**: No API usage charges during development
- **Fast Iteration**: Instant responses without rate limiting

**Transition to Real APIs**: Our API factory pattern allows seamless switching from mocks to real APIs by simply changing `USE_MOCK_APIS=false` and providing API keys.

### Adding New Features

1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Develop with mock APIs**: `USE_MOCK_APIS=true`
3. **Add tests**: Cover new functionality
4. **Update documentation**: README and code comments
5. **Submit PR**: Small, focused changes

## üö¢ Deployment

### Preview Deployment

Every pull request automatically deploys to a preview environment via Vercel.

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy database migrations
supabase db push

# Deploy Langflow workflows
# (Manual deployment via Langflow UI)
```

## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated Testing**: All PRs run tests with mock APIs
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript checks, and formatting
- **Preview Deployments**: Automatic Vercel previews for each PR
- **Production Deployment**: Auto-deploy on merge to main
