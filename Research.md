Competitors
Booking.com
Strongest competitor but doesnt include activities, ux isn't great, and is only partially open source.
Layla (formerly askLayla)
Dangerously close but very limiting free model(only 2-3 prompts before payment required). Also not agentic and not open source.
Ash Mentioned there was someone in the previous cohort that did something similar but had issues with context management, so we were advised to focus on that
Experts
Business
Business travel experts seem to focus on cost effectiveness and stress/safety of their employees. Advocate for flexible schedules(no tight layovers etc)
Vacation  
 Vacation travel experts emphasize cultural immersion and flexible/relaxed schedules. Advocate for avoiding tourist traps and focusing on authentic local experiences.
Travel Agents
Travel agents advocate for the importance of having a travel agent to do all the planning and be on call to keep things on track in the face of unexpected disaster(dramatic weather changes, steakboat cancelations etc). Also advocate for the value of the human element but we can ignore that.
Expert take aways
We need to ensure the travel agent is comprehensive and cost mindful. Also need to make sure it doesn't only show tourist attractions for the activities where possible, and doesn't jam pack the itinerary so the user has some leisure time in there. Could also make a dynamic update system to change the itinerary or suggest new points of interest on the fly in case a planned activity is unavailable.
