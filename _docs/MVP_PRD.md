## 🎨 User Experience Flow

```
1. User Intake (2-3 minutes)
   ├── Basic preferences (budget, dates, location)
   ├── Travel style assessment
   └── Automation level selection (0-10 slider)

   ├── Flight search (background)
   ├── Hotel search (background)
   └── Activity search (background)

3. AI Selection & User Review (1-2 minutes)
   ├── AI-selected flight options
   ├── AI-selected hotel options
   └── Activity filtering and selection

4. Checkout Simulation (30 seconds)
   ├── Bundle review

```

## 🔄 Fallback & Recovery

### **Booking Failure Scenarios**
| Scenario | Automation Level 0-3 | Automation Level 4-7 | Automation Level 8-10 |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Flight unavailable | Pause and ask user | Show 3 alternatives | Auto-select closest match |
| Hotel full | Manual selection | Auto-find similar hotel | Book alternative + notify |
| Activity closed | Skip or manual pick | Suggest replacement | Auto-replace with similar |

### **Mock Failure Simulation**
- **Random failure injection** (10% rate for testing)
- **Realistic error messages** (API timeouts, availability issues)
- **Recovery time tracking** (measure fallback effectiveness)

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### **Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)**
- **User Interface**: Progressive web app with mobile-first design
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context API
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom travel-themed components
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library with mock APIs

### **Backend (Supabase + Edge Functions)**
- **Database**: User sessions, preferences, mock bookings
- **API Layer**: Mock API responses for all external services
- **Authentication**: Simple session-based auth for testing
- **Storage**: PDF itineraries and user uploads

### **AI Integration (Langflow)**
- **Decision Engine**: Flight/hotel/activity selection logic
- **Fallback Logic**: Automated retry and alternative selection
- **User Profiling**: Preference learning and recommendation
- **Itinerary Generation**: Text generation for packing tips and schedules

### **Mock API Strategy**
```typescript
// Phase-based API implementation with seamless mock-to-real transition
const apiClient = process.env.USE_MOCK_APIS === 'true' 
  ? {
      flights: mockFlightAPI,      // Phase 1: Mock, Phase 2: Tequila API
      hotels: mockHotelAPI,        // Phase 1: Mock, Phase 2: Booking.com API
      activities: mockActivityAPI, // Phase 1: Mock, Phase 2: Viator API
      payments: mockPaymentAPI,    // Phase 1: Mock payments with Stripe interface
      ai: openAIClient,           // Phase 1: Real OpenAI API
    }
  : {
      flights: realFlightAPI,      // Production: Real APIs with browser fallbacks
      hotels: realHotelAPI,
      activities: realActivityAPI,
      payments: realPaymentAPI,
      ai: openAIClient,
    };

// Mock responses include:
// - Realistic flight data (Tequila/Amadeus format)
// - Hotel options (Booking.com format)
// - Activity listings with pricing (Viator format)
// - Payment processing simulation (Stripe format)
// - Browser automation fallback simulation
```
